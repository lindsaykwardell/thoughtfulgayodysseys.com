        R.M.'s relationship with words was at first a fractious struggle with
        dyslexia that left R.M. in tears on more than one occasion. As time and
        skills developed, a love for poetry, creativity, and story overthrew

        From their original secretive spy journals to their current work in
        progress, their words often explore the power of healing and connection
        through compassion, truth, and nature. R.M. is the author of their debut
        poetry book <em class="italic">Held</em>, releasing in 2025.
